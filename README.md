# Lexica Automata

## Please Note
This is an "in progress" build of the scripts I've been using for typing.  There's a few issues that I haven't been able to properly work out (see [Issues](#Issues)) but overall they should work well enough with only some minor tweaks.

## How to use
To use this, you'll want to download and install [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) v2.0.  This is the scripting suite that I'm using here.

To download this set of scripts, you can use git normally if you know how, or from the releases, or [here](https://github.com/syd-undermau/lexica-automata/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Once installed, you should be able to easily double click `main.ahk` to run.

## Layout
I've tried to divide the script into separate modules, and tried to comment things as best I can.  For a list of shortcuts, see [HOTKEYS](HOTKEYS.md).

### Need help?
Open up a GH Issue or send me an email at [lexica@brella.dev](mailto:lexica@brella.dev).  This script should include a basic version check as well that will direct you to update.

### Minor Issues
Occasionally, some modifiers can get stuck down. I was still debugging, but I think this happens when there's other keyboard software installed and running?

### Boring Legal
All scripts here outside of [lib](lib) are released under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). A copy is also included in LICENSE. You probably don't have to worry about this, but force of habit.
